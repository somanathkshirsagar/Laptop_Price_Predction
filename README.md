The Laptop Price Predictor is a web application designed to estimate the price of a laptop based on its specifications. The project utilizes a Random Forest Regressor, a supervised machine learning model, which achieves an impressive accuracy of 88%. The web application is developed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to input laptop specifications and obtain price predictions.

The project follows a data-driven approach, where a dataset consisting of laptop specifications and their corresponding prices is used for model training. Features such as processor type, RAM size, storage capacity, screen size, and graphics card details are considered as inputs for the model. The dataset is carefully analyzed and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables, ensuring the quality and reliability of the trained model.

The Random Forest Regressor is chosen as the machine learning algorithm for its ability to handle complex relationships and provide accurate predictions. It works by constructing an ensemble of decision trees and making predictions based on the consensus of these trees. With an accuracy of 88%, the model demonstrates its effectiveness in estimating laptop prices.

The web application, built with Streamlit, offers a user-friendly interface for individuals who want to determine the approximate price of a laptop based on its specifications. Users can input details such as processor type, RAM, storage capacity, screen size, and graphics card information. The model then processes these inputs and generates a price prediction, providing users with valuable information for their purchasing decisions.

In summary, the Laptop Price Predictor project leverages a Random Forest Regressor and Streamlit to create a web application that estimates the price of a laptop based on its specifications. With its high accuracy of 88%, the model provides users with reliable predictions, enabling them to make informed choices when purchasing laptops. The user-friendly interface enhances the overall experience, making the web application accessible and easy to use.
